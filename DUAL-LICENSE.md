**This software is under dual-licensing : AGPL and commercial. Please reach Ankaboot (the vendor) to get a commercial license.**

# Whats is dual licensing?

Dual licensing enables the open source community to continuously enhance its code while still being able to fund the development of the software from its commercial license. With dual licensing, the licensor can concurrently take advantage of the benefits of both proprietary and open source licenses by distributing software to licensees under both of these models.

This means that some businesses use a dual licensing model to distribute the same software under two different license types: (1) a version covered by a proprietary license (which may include the ability to further develop and commercially distribute that software as well as licensor warantee and added features); and (2) a version licensed under and subject to the limitations and obligations of an open source license, such as the AGPL.

# Could I use the opensource version for my business?

Any derivative of this software, if distributed or offered via SaaS, MUST BE opensourced under AGPL. The right way to used this software in a commercial software is to buy a commercial license or subscribe to a SaaS version of it. While Open Source software may be free to use, that does not mean it is free of obligation. To determine whether your intended use of this software is suitable for the AGPL, please contact us.

# When should I buy a commercial license?

If you need support, warranty, security assessment or any other specific needs (e.g : helping you integrate this library in a SaaS), you'll need a commercial license. Under the AGPL, you may not sublicense our source code or hold us liable for any damages. Open Source software is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.
